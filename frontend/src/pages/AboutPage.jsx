      <h1>About FlexTask</h1>
      <p>
        FlexTask is a modular task manager created to explore scalable MERN patterns. It focuses on clean
        service boundaries and secure data handling for individual users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is intentionally simple and focused. It solves the most important workflow first: assigning,
        tracking, and completing tasks with minimal friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your next step, you can extend this foundation with edit forms, due dates, priorities, and team-level
        collaboration.
