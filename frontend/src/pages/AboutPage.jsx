      <h1>About TaskForge</h1>
      <p>
        TaskForge is a full-stack project designed to demonstrate production-style MERN architecture: reusable routing,
        clear controller boundaries, protected APIs, and stateful React pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform is intentionally simple and focused. It solves the most important workflow first: assigning,
        tracking, and completing tasks with minimal friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your next step, you can extend this foundation with edit forms, due dates, priorities, and team-level
        collaboration.
